# Next Amazon

This is a Next.js variant of the [React Amazon](https://github.com/marothi-codes/amazon-clone-2-ui) project.

The aim here is to build a fully featured eCommerce Web Application by leveraging the SEO benefits of SSR (Server Side Rendering) as well as the modern benefits of using cloud functions to implement API specific functionality rather than using a REST API project for server side functionality this will allow for a more modular architecture.

MongoDB is the DBMS of choice again, although I know that PostgresQL could also be used to implement an application of this nature (of a distributed architecture).

We are in the age of the cloud after all are we not? So why not go serverless?

Next.js seems like React.js on steroids so I believe that it is going to be my daily driver for small to medium sized projects.
